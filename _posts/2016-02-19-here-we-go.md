# Here we go!

## Every year, new online services provide new promises for easy-to-use features and seamless integration with yada yada yada. Let's see how this service works, shall we?

Right now, I'm creating my first post. Simple, clean interface, Not very sure what else I can do here. Text style appears only when text is selected, which makes sense. I see that I can add an image. Let's test it! Kinda sucks. I can't scale it, yet it's blurry, so it's purposefully upscaling. Hmmm... I wonder if that is for responsiveness?

And now we test some more. Let's publish and see what happens next.
